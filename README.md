# Grand Slam
This repo was the frontend for my CNIT 280 final project. 
## Archived
This repo is part of my college coursework and will be archived as I have completed college and no changes will be made to them.
## Usage
Please do not use these project as your own, I built this project and it's supporting materials myself and it will be considered plagiarism.

**That being said** please feel free to reference any queries or scripts that are in this repo. I made this project open source so that any prospective students can look at (hopefully correct) answers.
### Running
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Unfortunately, I do not seem to have the SQL used to make the backend. I could probably reverse engineer it, but seeing as this exists for archival purposes and I have gotten much better at webdev, I am not going to worry about it.
## Prerequisites
This assumes that there is some hosted SQL server. We were provided one for class so initialization of one is not included.
## Issues
For any issues please create an issue in this repo and I will try to respond promptly.
